Knowledgebase
=============

Internet businesses are, in a sense, always open. Customers interact with your website 24/7, and when they have a question, they want an answer that minute. 

The best knowledge software anticipates your users' most common problems and makes it quick and easy for them to find the solution they need. That's why a knowledge base is also useful for customer service agents. While working on a user's ticket, an agent can interact with your intuitive knowledge base content to learn more about their problem.
