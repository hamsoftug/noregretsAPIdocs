Your clients are the core of your freelance business. Accounts/Clients in `WorkiceCRM <https://workice.com/>`_ will typically hold all information specific to a company that your organisation will have a relationship with. In real world terms an Account may be a business entity that is a qualified Sales Prospect, Customer, Supplier or Re-seller and can be used to track all interactions that take place between these entities and your organisation. The relationship between the account and contact records is one-to-many, such that there can be many contacts associated with a single account.

Contacts
""""""""
In Workice, a Contact is an individual who is typically associated with an Account (organisation) or Opportunity (qualified prospect). For example if Apple is the Account, then John Smith, Sales Manager of Apple is the Contact. This module holds all information relating to these individuals and also provides a vantage point for any history relating to a Contact record, for example if they sent you an Email.

List Accounts
""""""""""""""

The Accounts page is a list page that presents a summary of all your clients in a user-friendly table. Think of Accounts page as the "central station" of your client activity. Most of your day-to-day invoicing actions can be taken from the various links and buttons that appear on the Accounts page. And you can use the Accounts page as your starting point to explore more in-depth client information, view client projects, view client estimates, and more. Now, we’ll take a closer look at the setup of the Clients page, and the range of actions available to you on the Accounts page.

To view your client list page, go to the main sidebar and click the Accounts tab.
